Git is not a fan of what we're doing here.  To combat this, we use
`git checkout --orphan`, which very effectively discards all the history of
the branch for each tarball.  The benefit is much shorter download times,
since there's no big binary history.

Please feel free to open issues and discuss these images.  I've
intentionally left the issue tracker here open for just such discussion!
However, please do not submit pull requests.  Due to this repo's unique
nature, pull requests are not only impossible to review, but also break the
orphaned history and increase repository clone times for everyone (most
importantly for the [stackbrew](https://github.com/dotcloud/stackbrew)
maintainers who have to test and deploy these images often).
